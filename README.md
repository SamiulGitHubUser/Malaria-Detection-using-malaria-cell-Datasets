Malaria Datasets published on National Library of Medicine(NLM).segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the
Malaria Screener research activity. To reduce the burden for microscopists in resource-constrained regions and improve diagnostic 
accuracy. National Library of Medicine (NLM), have developed a mobile application that runs on a standard Android smartphone attached
to a conventional light microscope. Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P. falciparum-infected and 50 healthy patients
were collected and photographed at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh.

The dataset contains 2 folders
    **Infected
    **Uninfected

And a total of 27,558 images.
